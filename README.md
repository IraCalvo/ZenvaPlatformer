# ZenvaPlatformer
Class Game

This was the one of the first class game that I made back in April 2022. This was an introductionary class platformer game.
This game features:
-Simple WASD movement
-Jumping movement
-Enemy/Obstacles movement on a set path
-Obstacles that harm and kill the player
-Score UI and collectables
-Point A-B Platformer with multiple levels

What I learned in this class: was how to make the player move, learned about overall gravity scaling and velocity scaling to make things move. 
I also learned about collision boxes and how things interact with each other, so the palyer can be hurt by obstacles or interact with interactables. Additionally I also
added a moving platform that was not taught within the class. I leanred that inorder for the player to stay on top of this moving platform and not bug out and fall off 
of it is to make the player a child of the platform so that it can move with it now that the parent of the player is the platform.
